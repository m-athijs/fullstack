====================

Directus is a free and open-source database API and "headless" CMS. Unlike traditional CMS that encompass your entire project codebase, the decoupled approach of Directus offers an API and SDKs to connect your content to: websites, native apps, kiosks, IoT devices, or any other data-driven projects. Directus makes no assumptions about how you should architect your database – giving you complete freedom to optimize structure and performance for projects of any size or complexity. Built on top of the API is our feature-rich admin webapp (CMS) webapp dynamically maps to your database's schema, instantly providing your users/clients with an intuitive interface for managing content.
